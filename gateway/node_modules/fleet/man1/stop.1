.SH "NAME"
\fBfleet-stop\fR \-\- Stop processes running on drones\.
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.
.nf
fleet stop [<options>] <id0> [<id1>, <id2>\.\.\.]
.

.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Stop processes\. Get each \fBid\fR by running \fBfleet ps\fR\|\. It doesn\'t matter which
drone the process is running on, fleet spams the request out to all the drones
and ignores the request if the drone doesn\'t have the requested process id\.
.
.P
Leading \fB\'pid#\'\fR strings are ignored on ids so you can more easily copy the pids
from \fBfleet ps\fR output\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
If you haven\'t set a remote with \fBfleet remote\fR, you\'ll need to specify these
options:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
hub \- location of the hub as a "host:port" string
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
secret \- optional passphrase to connect to the hub
.
.IP "" 0
